It is estimated in terms of land, house, garden, industries, animals, gold, money, etc. accumulated by a person. Property helps a person to lead a better quality of life in the society. Valuable belongings of a person can be of two types:- Immovable property  which cannot be moved from one place to another. Eg. Land, Buildings, gardens. Movable property  which can be easily shifted from one place to another. Eg. Animals, furniture, machinery, gold, diamond, money, etc. These are also protected by public laws. 1.1 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY A product / process/ idea which is the outcome of the brain of a person and can be used on commercial scale for the benefit of humankind is called Intellectual Property. It refers to the creations of the mind, inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images and designs used on commercial scale. 1.2 FEATURES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Measured in terms of new ideas, processes, products, inventions and innovations developed by a person It requires a lot of intellectual inputs in terms of thinking, planning and fine tuning of new ideas/products/processes. It requires considerable amount of funds and other resources to develop new products/processes. It can be copied, reproduced and used by others resulting in the loss to the inventor. Hence protection of Intellectual Property is essential so that the inventor can derive maximum benefits from his invention. The rights to intangible property that is the product of human intellect is referred to Intellectual Property rights. Intellectual Property can be protected by copyright, trademark, patent, etc. The holder of the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is usually the person/persons who developed the process/ product, or the organisation that funded it. 1.3 FORMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Intellectual property rights can be broadly divided into two groups. 1.3.1 Primary rights Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, Trade secrets, Trade names, Domain names, Industrial design, Geographical Indications, etc. 1.3.2 Sui generis rights This refers to the things of their own kind or things with unique characteristics. This Latin expression literally means of its own kind. In law, it is a term used to identify a legal classification that exists independently of other categories due to the uniqueness or due to its specific creation of an entitlement or obligation. In Intellectual Property there are rights which are known as being sui generic to owners of a small class of works. Some examples of sui generic rights include Database rights, Mask work, Plant Breeders rights, Farmers rights, moral rights, Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). 1.4 CHOICE OF IPR PROTECTION An Intellectual Property can often be protected in more than one way. Therefore, an inventor has to decide as to which form of protection would be the most appropriate for his invention. This decision will be influenced by several factors, some of which are summarised below: Nature of Intellectual Property The type of Intellectual Property would often have the most critical impact on the choice of IPR system. For example, a cell line or a bacterial strain can be kept as a trade secret, a transgene or a plant variety cannot be. Pace of Technology Development If the pace of technology development in the area of invention is rapid, a trade secret approach would be preferable to patenting. Associated costs The costs associated with the acquisition and management of Intellectual Property Rights is a very important consideration. Generally, maintaining a trade secret is costlier than obtaining a patent. But, enforcing a patent, however, is often rather costly. In comparison to a patent, acquisition of Plant Breeders Rights(PBR) title is much expensive and complicated. Security considerations In the long run, it may become exceedingly difficult to maintain a trade secret. Therefore, one may often look for patents to protect an Intellectual Property. Need to show inventions Patents can be shown to investors for commercialisation of the Intellectual Property without compromising on the Intellectual Property Rights. The same cannot be done for trade secrets. Duration of protection Patents offer protection for a specified duration, viz., upto 20 years. If protection is sought for a longer duration, trade secrets are the only available option. A PBR protection, if available, would be for a longer duration (20 years or more) than that for patents. The type of protection sought Protection of plant varieties by a patent provides a more rigid control to the inventor (breeder) than does a PBR title. 1.5 MANAGEMENT OF IPR Intellectual Property Right is ordinarily acquired in the anticipation that the concerned intellectual property can be commercialised. A mere holding of the IPR does not lead to profit generation from the same. Often considerable research and development (R&amp;D) effort may be needed to make the intellectual property marketable. For example, following the patenting of a new pharmaceutical, say, an antibiotic, it has to undergo clinical trials and other tests and clearances before it can be allowed to for marketing. In addition, the production process has to be scaled up. Therefore, the holder of IPR has to manage the IPR portfolio in such a manner so that it generates some profit. IPR management involves the following activities: 1. Transfer of the IPR appropriately and at an optimum value to obtain attractive returns for the expense involved in generating the intellectual property. 2. Establishment of collaborative linkages to facilitate exploitation of the IPR 3. Monitoring infringements of the IPR and enforcing ones rights where necessary. 4. Renewal of patents and designs periodically in every country where they have been granted. 5. Quantitative evaluation of factors such as ratio of research and development investments and the royalty earned will have to be done periodically. This will enable the IPR holder to decide as to which IPRs are to be renewed in the different parts of the world. 1.6 BENEFITS FROM IPR It encourages and safeguards intellectual and artistic creations. It enables the dissemination of new ideas and technologies quickly and widely; this is achieved by the requirement of disclosure for grant of patents, etc. It encourages investments in research and development efforts. It produces consumers with the result of creations and inventions. It provides increased opportunities of distribution of the above effects across countries in a manner proportionate to the national levels of industrial and economic development. It promotes healthy competition for invention /innovation among the intellectuals. It helps in improving the quality of the product. 1.7 PROBLEMS OF IPR IPR has encouraged monopolies; many takeovers have been motivated by &gt; access to an IPR. The IPR situation in many cases is quite complicated. Monitoring and &gt; tackling of the IPR aspects of inventions (a) enhance costs (b) &gt; demand time, attention and effort and (c) may act as a &gt; disincentive for R&amp;D efforts. It is perceived by many as a threat to food security. It may adversely affect biological diversity and ecological balance. It may be detrimental to the livelihood of the poor in developing &gt; countries, and small farmers may become dependent on seed &gt; companies. Indigenous knowledge may be claimed as an invention/ innovation for &gt; profit to companies, and not to those who generated it. The procedure of registration, particularly patents, is very &gt; lengthy. It involves a lot of money transaction in registration, renewal and &gt; licensing. It invites lots of court cases due to infringements.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> INTRODUCTION AND MEANING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h1>
<p>Property refers to wealth or valuable things earned by a person. It is
estimated in terms of land, house, garden, industries, animals, gold,
money, etc. accumulated by a person. Property helps a person to lead a
better quality of life in the society. Valuable belongings of a person
can be of two types:-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><u>Immovable property</u> – which cannot be moved from one place to
another. Eg. Land, Buildings, gardens.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Movable property</u> – which can be easily shifted from one
place to another. Eg. Animals, furniture, machinery, gold, diamond,
money, etc. These are also protected by public laws.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="intellectual-property" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<p>A product / process/ idea which is the outcome of the brain of a person
and can be used on commercial scale for the benefit of humankind is
called Intellectual Property. It refers to the creations of the mind,
inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images and
designs used on commercial scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="features-of-intellectual-property" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> FEATURES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Measured in terms of new ideas, processes, products, inventions and
innovations developed by a person</p></li>
<li><p>It requires a lot of intellectual inputs in terms of thinking,
planning and fine tuning of new ideas/products/processes.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires considerable amount of funds and other resources to
develop new products/processes.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be copied, reproduced and used by others resulting in the
loss to the inventor. Hence protection of Intellectual Property is
essential so that the inventor can derive maximum benefits from his
invention.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rights to intangible property that is the product of human intellect
is referred to Intellectual Property rights. Intellectual Property can
be protected by copyright, trademark, patent, etc. The holder of the
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is usually the person/persons who
developed the process/ product, or the organisation that funded it.</p>
</div>
<div id="forms-of-intellectual-property-rights" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> FORMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Intellectual property rights can be broadly divided into two groups.</p>
<div id="primary-rights" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Primary rights</h3>
<p>Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, Trade secrets,
Trade names, Domain names, Industrial design, Geographical
Indications, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="sui-generis-rights" class="section level3" number="1.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> <em>Sui generis</em> rights</h3>
<p>This refers to the things of their own
kind or things with unique characteristics. This Latin expression
literally means “of its own kind.” In law, it is a term used to
identify a legal classification that exists independently of other
categories due to the uniqueness or due to its specific creation of
an entitlement or obligation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Intellectual Property there are rights which are known as being
‘<em>sui generic</em>’ to owners of a small class of works. Some examples of
<em>sui generic</em> rights include Database rights, Mask work, Plant
Breeder’s rights, Farmer’s rights, moral rights, Supplementary
Protection Certificate (SPC).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="choice-of-ipr-protection" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> CHOICE OF IPR PROTECTION</h2>
<p>An Intellectual Property can often be protected in more than one way.
Therefore, an inventor has to decide as to which form of protection
would be the most appropriate for his invention. This decision will be
influenced by several factors, some of which are summarised below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Nature of Intellectual Property</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of Intellectual Property would often have the most critical
impact on the choice of IPR system. For example, a cell line or a
bacterial strain can be kept as a trade secret, a transgene or a plant
variety cannot be.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Pace of Technology Development</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If the pace of technology development in the area of invention is
rapid, a trade secret approach would be preferable to patenting.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Associated costs</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The costs associated with the acquisition and management of
Intellectual Property Rights is a very important consideration.
Generally, maintaining a trade secret is costlier than obtaining a
patent. But, enforcing a patent, however, is often rather costly. In
comparison to a patent, acquisition of “Plant Breeder’s Rights”(PBR)
title is much expensive and complicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Security considerations</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In the long run, it may become exceedingly difficult to maintain a
trade secret. Therefore, one may often look for patents to protect an
Intellectual Property.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Need to show inventions</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Patents can be shown to investors for commercialisation of the
Intellectual Property without compromising on the Intellectual
Property Rights. The same cannot be done for trade secrets.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>Duration of protection</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Patents offer protection for a specified duration, <em>viz.,</em> upto 20
years. If protection is sought for a longer duration, trade secrets
are the only available option. A PBR protection, if available, would
be for a longer duration (20 years or more) than that for patents.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><u>The type of protection sought</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Protection of plant varieties by a patent provides a more rigid
control to the inventor (breeder) than does a PBR title.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="management-of-ipr" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> MANAGEMENT OF IPR</h2>
<p>Intellectual Property Right is ordinarily acquired in the anticipation
that the concerned intellectual property can be commercialised. A mere
holding of the IPR does not lead to profit generation from the same.
Often considerable research and development (R&amp;D) effort may be needed
to make the intellectual property marketable. For example, following the
patenting of a new pharmaceutical, say, an antibiotic, it has to undergo
clinical trials and other tests and clearances before it can be allowed
to for marketing. In addition, the production process has to be scaled
up. Therefore, the holder of IPR has to manage the IPR portfolio in such
a manner so that it generates some profit. IPR management involves the
following activities:</p>
<p>1. Transfer of the IPR appropriately and at an optimum value to obtain
attractive returns for the expense involved in generating the
intellectual property.</p>
<p>2. Establishment of collaborative linkages to facilitate exploitation
of the IPR</p>
<p>3. Monitoring infringements of the IPR and enforcing one’s rights where
necessary.</p>
<p>4. Renewal of patents and designs periodically in every country where
they have been granted.</p>
<p>5. Quantitative evaluation of factors such as ratio of research and
development investments and the royalty earned will have to be done
periodically. This will enable the IPR holder to decide as to which IPRs
are to be renewed in the different parts of the world.</p>
</div>
<div id="benefits-from-ipr" class="section level2" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> BENEFITS FROM IPR</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It encourages and safeguards intellectual and artistic creations.</p></li>
<li><p>It enables the dissemination of new ideas and technologies quickly
and widely; this is achieved by the requirement of disclosure for
grant of patents, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>It encourages investments in research and development efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>It produces consumers with the result of creations and inventions.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides increased opportunities of distribution of the above
effects across countries in a manner proportionate to the national
levels of industrial and economic development.</p></li>
<li><p>It promotes healthy competition for invention /innovation among the
intellectuals.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps in improving the quality of the product.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="problems-of-ipr" class="section level2" number="1.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> PROBLEMS OF IPR</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>IPR has encouraged monopolies; many takeovers have been motivated by
&gt; access to an IPR.</p></li>
<li><p>The IPR situation in many cases is quite complicated. Monitoring and
&gt; tackling of the IPR aspects of inventions (a) enhance costs (b)
&gt; demand time, attention and effort and (c) may act as a
&gt; disincentive for R&amp;D efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>It is perceived by many as a threat to food security.</p></li>
<li><p>It may adversely affect biological diversity and ecological balance.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be detrimental to the livelihood of the poor in developing
&gt; countries, and small farmers may become dependent on seed
&gt; companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Indigenous knowledge may be claimed as an invention/ innovation for
&gt; profit to companies, and not to those who generated it.</p></li>
<li><p>The procedure of registration, particularly patents, is very
&gt; lengthy.</p></li>
<li><p>It involves a lot of money transaction in registration, renewal and
&gt; licensing.</p></li>
<li><p>It invites lots of court cases due to infringements.</p></li>
